# BMI app

A Flutter project with using flutter_bloc package to set the changes on the app.

## The Tools I Used To Build The App:  

1) flutter framework  
2) flutter_bloc package  
3) I used cubit instead of bloc  

## The Structure Of The Project.  
**There are four folders in lib folder:**    
1_ 'bussiness_logic' this folder contains the cubit iplemenntation
2_ 'comp' this folder contains some widget that help in creating the same widget but different parameters  
3_ 'constants' this folder contains file that has the colors of the app  
4_ 'screens' this folder contains two screens 'home_page' & 'result_page'  

## The App Final Result:
