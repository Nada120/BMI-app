# BMI app 🏋️🥊  

A Flutter project with using flutter_bloc package to set the changes on the app.

## The Tools I Used To Build The App 🧰👷  

1) flutter framework  
2) flutter_bloc package  
3) I used cubit instead of bloc  

## The Structure Of The Project.  
**There are four folders in lib folder:**    
🟧 'bussiness_logic' this folder contains the cubit iplemenntation  
🟦 'comp' this folder contains some widget that help in creating the same widget but different parameters    
🟩 'constants' this folder contains file that has the colors of the app    
🟪 'screens' this folder contains two screens 'home_page' & 'result_page'      

## The App Final Result: 😄💟
